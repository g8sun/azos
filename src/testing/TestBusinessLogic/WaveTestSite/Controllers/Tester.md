# Tester Controller
This content comes from a markdown file which is inlined as embedded resource next to the controller class.
The file needs to be called the same name as the controller class type, and must be in the same folder/namespace.

This paragraph contains sentences made up of multiple words which
can span 
many lines
and these words will 
be glued together as-if
written
with spaces
between
them!





This is yet another paragraph which is far down the line. See the `{@Person}` type for more details
