  /// Represents a pile of objects - a custom memory heap that can store native CLR objects in a tightly-serialized form.
  /// Piles can be either local (allocate local RAM on the server), or distributed (allocate RAM on many servers).
  /// This class is designed primarily for applications that need to store/cache very many
  /// (100s of millions on local, billions on distributed) of objects in RAM (and/or possibly on disk) without causing
  /// the local CLR's GC scans of huge object graphs.
  /// Implementors of this interface are custom memory managers that favor the GC performance in apps with many objects at
  /// the cost of higher CPU usage. The implementor must be thread-safe for all operations unless stated otherwise on a member level.
  /// The memory represented by this class as a whole is not synchronizable, that is - it does not support functions like
  /// Interlocked-family, Lock, MemoryBarriers and the like that regular RAM supports. Should a need arise to interlock within the pile -
  /// a custom CLR-based lock must be used to synchronize access to pile as a whole, for example:
  ///   a Get does not impose a lock on ALL concurrent writes through the pile (a write does not block all gets either).
  /// The enumeration of the pile is thread-safe, however it does not guarantee the snapshot stability as parallel mutations may happen while enumeration takes place.
