# File Gateway

Provides a service to external callers to download and upload files on a local disk/network
using designated internal disk/network mapping.

The use of gateway obviates the need to use external services such as SCP/FTPS etc. as it allows to perform
similar actions via API (such as REST) interface via well-known endpoints
